# Ising-spins-on-networks

Physical simulation - 2D-grid and Barabási-network based spin systems

In this project I tried to simulate a spin-system on a two different topologies: on a 2D-grid and on a linearly preferential network (also known as Barabási-Albert network). In this simulation my goal was to the critical parameters for phase transition. 

A good example of Barabási-Albert network are the social networks. Based on that network I implemented the Sznajd-model, which is a social network model for voter behaviour. In one paper it was used to model the general election of Brasil in 2002[]. It’s basically the same (-1,1/up-down) notion alike physical spins, but now it represents binary opinions (eg: political affiliation, stance on social issues).

See the report for my results. You may have to download it, as Github doesn't really like pdf format.
